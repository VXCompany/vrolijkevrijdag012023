    "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, with deep learning you don't have to tell the model what the features of the data are that influence the outcome, it will figure it out by itself.\n",
    "This is the reason deep learning is more usefull for unstructured data like video/audio etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "In machine learning, a **model** is a function with learnable parameters that maps an input to an output.\n",
    "The optimal parameters are obtained by training the model on data. \n",

    "A well-trained model will provide an accurate mapping from the input to the desired output.\n",
