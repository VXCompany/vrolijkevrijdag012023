    "## What does a machine learning model do?\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, a model is a function with learnable parameters that maps an input to an output.\n",
    "The optimal parameters are obtained by training the model on data. \n",
    "\n",
    "A well-trained model will provide an accurate mapping from the input to the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*The most common type of machine learning is to learn the mapping Y = f(X) to make predictions of Y for new X. This is called predictive modeling or predictive analytics and our goal is to make the most accurate predictions possible. It relies havely on mathematics: like differentials and the gradient function dY = f'(X)/dX to make predictions. There are of course many other mathematical functions to help create a model, tensorflow lets you configure the model to use these standard solutions or create your own custom ones*"
